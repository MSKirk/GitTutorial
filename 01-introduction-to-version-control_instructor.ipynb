    "### What is version control?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of us have experienced some situation similar to the above, and this is the situation version control aims to solve.\n",
    "Version control systems are a way to track and store changes to a document so that you can continually change one file without losing any of its previous contents.\n",
    "Since all the changes are saved, it is possible to go back to an earlier state of the document and recover old versions of some or all of the file, without having to save multiple separate documents with different names.\n",
    "This is extremely useful for both text documents, such as paper manuscripts, and code files, and makes it worth strongly considering using some kind of version control even if you expect to be the only person working on the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful aspect of version control is that you can make different changes separately and combine them together.\n",
    "Again this can be extremely useful even when working alone, but where it really shines is in working with other people.\n",
    "This is because the changes don't have to be made on the same computer, so several people can be working on a file at once and those changes can then be combined into your file locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have used some version tracking capability like the '`Track changes`' option in Word, for example, and if you have heard of or used Git you may also have heard of tools such as RCS, CVS, Subversion or Mercurial. All of these do some amount of version control in different ways, and all have advantages and disadvantages. We will be teaching Git in this course because it is very commonly used and has good tools available for sharing and collaboration, such as GitHub and GitLab."

    "- our name and email address,\n",
    "- what our preferred text editor is,\n",
    "- and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).\n",
